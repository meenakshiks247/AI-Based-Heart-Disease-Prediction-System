# 🫀 AI-Based Heart Disease Prediction System

---

## 1️⃣ Project Overview

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. Early detection enables timely medical intervention and lifestyle modification. This project provides a **full-stack AI healthcare decision-support system** that predicts heart disease risk using both **clinical diagnostic data** and **large-scale population screening data**.

The system demonstrates the complete AI lifecycle:

**Data Ingestion → EDA → Preprocessing → Safe Training → Evaluation → REST API → React Frontend.**

The goal is not only prediction accuracy but also **clinical trust, scalability, and real-world applicability**.

## ⭐ Strategic Modeling Logic — The Two-Model Approach

Healthcare decision making occurs at multiple stages. Instead of forcing one model to solve every problem, this system implements **two specialized AI models optimized for different clinical objectives**.

---

### 🩺 Model A — Clinical Diagnostic Model (Cleveland Dataset)

**Goal:** Assist healthcare specialists in confirming diagnosis using advanced clinical indicators.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- ECG results
- Chest pain classification
- Fluoroscopy vessel measurements
- Stress test information

These are **high-signal diagnostic features** typically available inside hospitals.

#### Optimization Strategy

**Priority:** High Recall + Interpretability.

Missing a diseased patient is more dangerous than generating a false alert.

**Selected Model:** Logistic Regression Pipeline.

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Highly interpretable feature weights
- Transparent probability outputs
- Clinically explainable decisions
- Stable generalization on small datasets

**Performance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 80.3% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.871 |
| Recall | 0.849 |

**Clinical Role:** Doctor-assisted diagnostic confirmation.

---

### ❤️ Model B — Population Screening Model (Cardiovascular Dataset)

**Goal:** Identify heart disease risk patterns across the general population using non-invasive indicators.

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- Height, Weight
- Blood Pressure
- Smoking habits
- Alcohol intake
- Physical activity

These signals reflect lifestyle risk rather than confirmed diagnosis.

#### Optimization Strategy

**Priority:** ROC-AUC + Scalability + Stability.

Population screening must handle noisy, diverse real-world data.

**Selected Model:** LightGBM Gradient Boosting Pipeline.

**Why LightGBM?**
- Efficient training on large datasets
- Captures non-linear feature interactions
- Handles large tabular datasets effectively
- Strong performance stability

**Performance:**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 73.4% |
| ROC-AUC | 0.799 |

**Population Role:** Early risk screening and preventive healthcare monitoring.

## 4️⃣ Machine Learning Pipeline (`ml/`)

The project follows a structured workflow to ensure reliability.

---

### Data Preparation

**Outlier Management:**

Clinical features such as cholesterol (`chol`) and resting blood pressure (`trestbps`) are stabilized using Interquartile Range (IQR) Capping.

Values exceeding $Q3 + 1.5 \times IQR$ are capped rather than removed. Dataset size preserved: $N = 1{,}025$.

---

### Duplicate Removal

Duplicate patient records inflate model performance.

**Utility:** `ml/deduplicate.py`

**Strategies:** `keep-first`, `keep-random`, `keep-most-representative`.

**Output:** `ml/data/heart_cleaned_dedup.csv`

---

### Safe Splitting

**Script:** `ml/safe_split.py`

**Features:**
- Stratified 80/20 split
- Zero overlap verification
- Leakage prevention

**Outputs:** `train.csv`, `test.csv`

---

## 5️⃣ The Evolutionary Workflow — Approach 1 → N

---

### Approach 1 — Clinical Baseline

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | Cleveland (~303 patients) |
| **Model** | Logistic Regression |
| **Goal** | Understand feature influence |
| **Accuracy** | 80.3% |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.871 |

**Gap Identified:** Small dataset risked overfitting.

---

### Approach 2 — Safe Training Pipeline

**Goal:** Remove optimistic bias.

**Methods:**
- Deduplication
- Leakage detection
- Cross-Validation

**Scripts:** `leakage_scan.py`, `verify_overfitting.py`, `safe_split.py`

**Outcome:** Reliable performance estimates.

---

### Approach 3 — Scaling to Big Data

| | |
|---|---|
| **Dataset** | Cardiovascular (~68K patients) |
| **Focus Shift** | Diagnosis → Population Screening |

**Feature Engineering:**
- Age converted days → years
- Outlier stabilization

---

### Approach N — Gradient Boosting Optimization

| | |
|---|---|
| **Model** | LightGBM |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.799 |

**Reason:** Traditional linear models reached performance limits.

LightGBM captured:
- Non-linear interactions
- Complex lifestyle relationships

Most stable performance across folds.
